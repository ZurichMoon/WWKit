 @method captureDevicePointOfInterestForPoint:
 @abstract
 Converts a point in layer coordinates to a point of interest in the coordinate space of the capture device providing
 input to the layer.

 A CGPoint in layer coordinates.
 
 @result
 A CGPoint in the coordinate space of the capture device providing input to the layer.
 
 @discussion
 AVCaptureDevice pointOfInterest is expressed as a CGPoint where {0,0} represents the top left of the picture area,
 and {1,1} represents the bottom right on an unrotated picture.  This convenience method converts a point in
 the coordinate space of the receiver to a point of interest in the coordinate space of the AVCaptureDevice providing
 input to the receiver.  The conversion takes frameSize and videoGravity into consideration.
